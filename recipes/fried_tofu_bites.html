    <h3>I created this recipe for my boyfriend who loves fried tofu.</br>
        I wanted them bite sized so they could be put into any dish!</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 block of extra firm tofu</li>
        <li>1 cup of panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup of flour</li>
        <li>1 can of chickpea liquid or 2 eggs whisked</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
        <li>Optional: seasoning for breading</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain tofu, but don't press or fully dry it (having it still slightly wet will help the flour stick to the pieces better)</li>
        <li>Cut the tofu into bite size cubes</li>
        <li>Get out 3 bowls</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 bowl with flour</li>
                <li>1 bowl with chickpea liquid (or egg)</li>
                <li>1 bowl with bread crumbs (add seasoning if you want extra flavor)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*You may need to add more to each bowl if you start running low</p>
        <li>Add oil to a pan (about Â¼ of an inch deep) and turn heat to medium/medium high</li>
        <li>Take one or two pieces of the tofu cubes and roll them around in the flour so all sides are coated and they feel dry</li>
        <li>Dunk those pieces into the chickpea liquid or eggs</li>
        <li>Drop those pieces into the bread crumbs and coat all sides</li>
            <p>*You can bread all the pieces first and set them on a plate or bread them as you go</p>
        <li>Once the oil is hot and you have your pieces breaded, start placing them in the pan, leaving some room to flip them over (I use a fork for this)</li>
        <li>Flip each tofu bite over when the bottom becomes golden brown (about 2-3 minutes each side but also depending on your heat)</li>
            <p>*If the pieces are browning too quickly or getting too dark, turn the heat down</p>
        <li>Remove each piece from the pan and place on a plate lined with a paper towel</li>
        <li>EAT THOSE SWEET CRISPY BABIES!</li>
    </ol>
